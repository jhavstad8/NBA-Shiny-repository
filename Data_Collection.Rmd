# Data Collection
In order to create a statistic to evaluate players, I need the players' data to do so. There is probably a data set with this information already out there, but I will practice web scraping data in this RMarkdown file. I will gather information on each player from the 2022-2023 season, which is the most recent full season at the time I am writing this.

```{r}
# this is one of the packages you can use to webscrape data
library(rvest)
```

Each table I will webscrape in this file contains players who are eligible and each table is sorted alphabetically by the players' last names.

## Total Stats (Season-Long)
```{r}
url1 <- "https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2023_totals.html"
wp1 <- read_html(url1)
```

```{r}
# the nodes such as totals_stats come from using selector gadget extension on google chrome
totals <- html_table(html_nodes(wp1, "#totals_stats"), fill = TRUE)[[1]]
write.csv(totals, "totals.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r}
head(totals)
```

This table represents full season stats for each player. For example, the total points the player scored, the total rebounds the player grabbed, etc. 

## Per Game Stats
```{r}
url2 <- "https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2023_per_game.html"
wp2 <- read_html(url2)
```

```{r}
game <- html_table(html_nodes(wp2, "#per_game_stats"), fill = TRUE)[[1]]
write.csv(game,"per_game.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r}
head(game)
```

This table represents per game stats for each player. For example, the points a player scored per game played, the shots a player attempted per game played, etc.

## Advanced Stats
```{r}
url3 <- "https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2023_advanced.html"
wp3 <- read_html(url3)
```

```{r}
advanced <- html_table(html_nodes(wp3, "#advanced_stats"), fill = TRUE)[[1]]
write.csv(advanced,"advanced.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r}
head(advanced)
```

This table represents the advanced stats for each player. Some of these stats are PER (Player Evaluation Rating), TS% (True Shooting Percentage), and WS (Win Shares). These advanced stats usually have formulas to calculate them based on other stats, and advanced stats are often used by the fans, media, coaches, and management to evaluate or assess players in a more in-depth manner.


## Shooting Stats
```{r}
url4 <- "https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2023_shooting.html"
wp4 <- read_html(url4)
```

```{r}
shooting <- html_table(html_nodes(wp4, "#shooting_stats"), fill = TRUE)[[1]]
write.csv(shooting,"shooting.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r}
colnames(shooting) <- as.character(unlist(shooting[1,]))
shooting <- shooting[-1,]
head(shooting)
```
```{r}
# these columns below represent % of shot attempts from each of the various distances
colnames(shooting)[11:16] <- paste0("%",colnames(shooting)[11:16]) 
# these columns below represent the % of shot attempts made from each of the various distances
colnames(shooting)[18:23] <- paste0(colnames(shooting)[18:23],"%")
# these columns below represent the % of made 2 and 3 pointers which were assisted
colnames(shooting)[25:26] <- c("2ast","3ast")
# these columns represent % of made baskets which were dunks and number of dunks
colnames(shooting)[28:29] <- c("%Dunks", "#Dunks")
#these columns represent 3 point shooting from the corner (both percent of 3 point shots and percentage of those shots made)
colnames(shooting)[31:32] <- c("%C3", "C3%")
# delete blank columns and the columns which represent heaves
del <- c(10,17,24,27,30,33,34,35)
shooting <- select(shooting, -del)

head(shooting)
```

This table represents the shooting stats for each player. We can see a breakdown of a player's shot attempts and success from different areas on the court. This table also includes information such as the percent of made baskets that come from assists.

# Data Wrangling

First, we need to remove the duplicate player values from each data set. These occur when players get traded and they have recorded values for their whole season, their stats with the first team only, and their stats with the second team only. By removing duplicates, we now only have player values for their entire season rather than for individual teams and a limited amount of games.

## Remove Duplicates
```{r}
# remove player duplicate values
totals <- totals[!duplicated(totals$Player),]
game <- game[!duplicated(game$Player),]
advanced <- advanced[!duplicated(advanced$Player),]
shooting <- shooting[!duplicated(shooting$Player),]
```

Now, there is only one instance of each player in all of these data sets.

## Merging Data Sets

Now that we have 4 different data sets with various statistics about each NBA player in the 2022-2023 season, we can merge the data sets into one large data set with all of the statistics that may be valuable to our player evaluation formula.

```{r}
NBA23 <- merge(totals,advanced, by = 'Player')
del <- c(31,32,33,34,35,36,49,54)
NBA23 <- select(NBA23, -del)
head(NBA23)
```

First, I merged the totals and advanced data sets by Player so that each of our stats match up correctly to the correct player.
Now I will merge this new data set with the shooting data set.

```{r}
NBA23 <- merge(NBA23,shooting, by = 'Player')
head(NBA23)
```

This new data set still has repeated columns and slightly new variable names, so I will have to clean that up.

## Remove similar columns

```{r}
# create vector with repeating columns to delete them from the data set
same <- c(33,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,65,70)
NBA23 <- select(NBA23, -same)
head(NBA23)
```
Now, each column represents a different statistic, but we need to rename the variables so they are easier to reference when we need to access them.

## Change variable names
```{r}
NBA23 <- NBA23 %>%
  rename(Rk = Rk.x, 
         Pos = Pos.x, 
         Age = Age.x, 
         Tm = Tm.x,
         G = G.x,
         MP = MP.x,
         'FG%' = 'FG%.x',
         '3P%' = '3P%.x',
         '2P%' = '2P%.x'
         )
head(NBA23)
```
Now each variable name is simpler and does not contain the ".x" or ".y" from merging.

## Convert variables to numeric

```{r}
NBA23 <- mutate_at(NBA23, vars(c(4,6:66)), as.numeric)
head(NBA23)
```

Now, the continuous variables in our dataset are numeric as they should be.

# Final Data Set
```{r}
write.csv(NBA23,"NBA23.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

This data set will be used to create the player evaluation metric and contains the individual data sets of totals, advanced, and shooting. I decided to not use the per game data set as all of those statistics can be calculated from the totals data set.

```{r}
dim(NBA23)
```

The "NBA23" data set contains 66 columns (variables) and 540 rows representing the 540 different players from the 2022-2023 NBA season.
